          Boys don’t keep diaries―or do they? The launch of an exciting and
          innovatively illustrated new series narrated by an unforgettable kid
          every family can relate to It’s a new school year, and Greg Heffley
          finds himself thrust into middle school, where undersized weaklings
          share the hallways with kids who are taller, meaner, and already
          shaving. The hazards of growing up before you’re ready are uniquely
          revealed through words and drawings as Greg records them in his diary.
